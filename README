# About ninja2bazel

As the name somewhat implies this tool is meant to translate ninja build files to bazel, given that
cmake can generate ninja files it's a great way to bazelify cmake builds.

It has been used successfully to translate complicated builds with more than 3000 files (headers and
sources files) with hundreds of dependencies and tens of folders.

# Using ninja2bazel

It's usually an iterative process, unless you have a dead simple build without any external
dependencies (even openssl) you will most probably to run it multiple time in its simpliest version
you need to provide two arguments: the build.ninja file and the directory with the source of the
code.

## A simple example: hiredis
For instance for the `hiredis` project that is fairly straightforward the command was:
```
parser.py -p "." ~/Work/hiredisbuild/build/build.ninja ~/Work/hiredisbuild/hiredis
```

`-p` specify the prefix in this case `.` means the top level directory in `~/Work/hiredisbuild/hiredis`
It assumed that the code was checked out in ~/Work/hiredisbuild/hiredis and the build file for cmake were in `~/Work/hiredisbuild/build`.

## A more advanced example: foundation DB


First make your task easier: specify only the targets that you need with --top-level-target, in this example we will only bazelify the shared client library: `lib/libfdb_c.dylib` (on a MacOS device, would be lib/libfdb_c.so on a Linux/*BSD).

In this example the code for Foundation DB is checked-out in `~/Work/foundationdb/src` and the build folder for cmake is in `~/Work/foundationdb/build_output/`.

The initial command line is similar to the one of example above with the notable exception of `--top-level-target`.

```
parser.py -p "." --top-level-target lib/libfdb_c.dylib  ~/Work/foundationdb/build_output/build.ninja ~/Work/foundationdb/src/
```

This won't be enough because of third-party dependencies but we will cover that soon after.

Foundation DB bazelification allows us to demonstrate a new capability with `ninja2bazel`, use
pre-built artifacts. It is notouriously public that foundationDB uses mono to generate C++ from
`flow` files but we don't want to deal with that so instead we will use pre-generated files to not
have to deal with mono during the bazel build, of course it means that every time you want to
upgrade your version of foundationDB you have to generate the c++ files from the flow files but
you most probably will have to do the same for the Bazel files so :shrug:.

### Dealing with third-party dependencies
When we inspect the output of `ninja2bazel` we can notice that it prints messages about found
external dependencies, for instance:

```
root - INFO - Marking /opt/homebrew/lib/libcrypto.a as external - Line: 236
root - INFO - Marking /opt/homebrew/Cellar/boost@1.85/1.85.0_3/lib/libboost_context-mt.a as external - Line: 236
```

It has clearly found external dependencies but don't know how to map them to proper bazel
modules, we will have to do that.

Just checking for `Marking .... as external` is not enough usually we have to look for other
signals in the log
